Tower of Dracula
================

Small multiplayer game based on a certain NES game. Player 1 assumes the role of a vampire hunter trying to make his way to a big glowing orb for some reason. Player 2 plays the part of a master vampire that can summon minions I guess? As Player 1, you will have to destroy enemies as you make your way to the orb with your whip. As Player 2, you must track the progress of Player 1 and try to prevent him from reaching his goal in time by creating "monstahs" to impede his path.
